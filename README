                                                     Album Cover Art Downloader                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
   Here's a program that will semi-automatically download album cover images for your music collection. All you                   
   have to do is point it at the root of your music directory and for each directory, the program will download a                 
   set of corresponding (well, best guess) album covers from the Internet, from which you can choose one that suits               
   your fancy.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                  
   Currently supported image providers:                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
     * Amazon.com                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
   At least the following programs make use of the cover images:                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
     * Ones that follow the .desktop-entry spec, for example KDE and GNOME.                                                       
     * Windows XP Explorer                                                                                                        
     * Windows Media Player 9+                                                                                                    
     * CDcover, an XMMS plugin                                                                                                    
     * CoverViewer, another XMMS plugin.                                                                                          
     * wmalbum, a WindowMaker dock applet                                                                                         
     * Various WinAMP plugins, for example ShowCover.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                  
   Requirements                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
   In order to run this piece of software you'll need:                                                                            
                                                                                                                                  
     * Python 2 or better with python-xmlbase.                                                                                    
     * QT >= 2.3 or >= 3.0 and PyQT, the Python bindings.                                                             
     * ImageMagick (or compatible) /usr/bin/convert (for converting the covers from jpeg to png format). (not              
       needed in 1.1)                                                                                                   
     * PyAmazon (included) and an Amazon Web Services Developer's Token.                                                 
                                                                                                                           
       You can get the token in approximately 5 seconds from this page. Once you get the token, put it into a file                
       called amazonkey.txt in your home directory or this program's directory.                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
       Don't tell anyone, but it seems that currently you can put in any number and it will work.                                 
                                                                                                                                  
     * Python Imaging Library                                                                                                     
   On Debian the following command should get you rolling in a jiffy:                                                             
                                                                                                                                  
                   # apt-get install python-qt3 python-imaging python-xmlbase                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                 
   Note that since the program doesn't make any use of ID3-tags or similar, the artist and album names are guessed                
   from the pathname only. If your directories have utterly incomprehensible names, don't worry, you can still type               
   in the artist and album names manually.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
   Usage                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
   Once you have the prerequisites sorted out, go ahead and run albumart-qt. It is the QT frontend to the                      
   program.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
   Click File|Open and navigate to the directory containing the albums you want to find cover images for. The                     
   program will load all the directories under the path you chose and try to guess an artist and album for each                   
   entry. A green indicator beside a directory means that it already has a cover image.                                           
                                                                                                                                  
   Now pick a directory from the list and check that the artist and album fields at the top-right corner are                      
   sensible. Now click Download Covers. After a few seconds you should see a list of cover images on the right. If                
   no images are found, try to simplify the artist and album fields (e.g. clear the album field completely). You                  
   can also drop an image from your file manager on the list to use that one.                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
   Go ahead and choose a suitable cover from the list. Finally, click Set as Cover to confirm your choice.                        
                                                                                                                                  
   Internals                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
   The cover images are saved in each directory as follows:                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
     * folder.jpg for Windows XP                                                                                                  
     * .folder.png and an Icon entry in .directory for Konqueror, etc.
